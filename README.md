# Devjobs web app

This is my solution for the challenge on [Devjobs web app](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/devjobs-web-app-HuvC_LP4l) on DevProject by codementor

## Overview

Build a jobs board that pulls the data from a local JSON file. This is a great opportunity to practice JS and get to grips with a framework/library of your choice!.

Note: I try to go to the next level and made for the "local JSON file" and API in NodeJS, database in MongoDB.
